# NueroTaskFlask

To start nueroflask on WSL, Linux, or (shudder) MacOS, from the project directory run "python3 -m venv venv" followed by "source venv/bin/activate"

install dependencies with "pip install -r requirements.txt" (in the venv), and flask run will start the server.

While this portion of the project has felt like a dismal failure, i still will be using this repo, because I do actually want to build my app, but not with flask. If you or anyone seeing this wants to watch and leave thoughts or comments it would be very helpful and I would appreciate it. I hope that in a year or two this will be entertainment to someone bored enough to dig this far back in the repo history.
